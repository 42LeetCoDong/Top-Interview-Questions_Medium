Tree is a special type of graphs, so the two usual techniques used to traverse a graph are also applicable to trees.

We recommend: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal, Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node and Number of Islands.

Note that some of the tree problems can also be asked in n-ary tree format, so make sure you know what an n-ary tree is.

**Note:** Although Number of Islands is not a tree problem, it can be represented as a graph and therefore we categorize it as a graph problem.
